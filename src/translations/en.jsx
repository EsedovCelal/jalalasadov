The main purpose of developing this project was to strengthen my understanding of user interaction on a web page. I used HTML to structure the interface and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality. Through this project, I learned how to manipulate the DOM, handle user inputs, and update elements dynamically without reloading the page. Although the project is small in scale, it helped me strengthen my JavaScript knowledge and improved my ability to connect logic with design. This experience enhanced my problem-solving skills and motivated me to work on more advanced interactive web applications in the future.",

Users can create their own coin collections, add new coins, or remove existing ones.The project also includes user account creation (Sign Up) and login (Log In) functionality. Users cannot access subsequent pages without logging in. Additionally, users can create their own passwords and securely log into the system. This feature provided a practical understanding of authentication principles and ensured a secure user experience.This project gave me hands-on experience with front-end and back-end integration, improved my skills in working with databases, and helped me better understand user interaction design. Moreover, using React and Node.js, I learned how to build a dynamic and interactive application. This project significantly enhanced my web development skills and provided the experience necessary to tackle more complex projects in the future.",
